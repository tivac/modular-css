## Features

`modular-css` implements the best features of the CSS Modules spec and then adds on several extra features to make for a smoother developer experience.

@import "./feature-scoped-selectors.md"

@import "./feature-composing-styles.md"

@import "./feature-values.md"

@import "./feature-values-importing.md"

@import "./feature-values-namespaced.md"

@import "./feature-values-wildcard.md"

### Other Features

These features can help when you find yourself bumping up against the edges of a few specific problems in `modular-css` but are best used sparingly.

@import "./feature-overriding-styles.md"

@import "./feature-composing-files.md"
