## vs CSS Modules

While `modular-css` was originallly built directly off the CSS Modules spec, during the course of development some decisions have been made that have broken 100% compatibility. In general these changes have been made in an attempt to try and add consistency or pave cowpaths. There have also been a few feature additions that enable solving new classes of problems or fix pain points in the spec.

### :global

In CSS Modules the `:global` pseudo-class allows usage with or without parentheses around its arguments.

```css
/* CSS Modules */
:global .one { ... }
:global(.one) { ... }
```

In `modular-css` only the parenthesized form is allowed to reduce ambiguity around which selectors/names are being made global.

```css
/* modular-css */
:global(.one) { ... }
```

### Scope

In CSS Modules it is possible to switch back and forth from local and global scope using `:global` and `:local`.

```css
/* CSS Modules */
.localA :global .global-b .global-c :local(.localD.localE) .global-d { ... }
```

In `modular-css` all CSS is local by default, and since `:global()` is [required to use parentheses](#scoped-selectors) there is no need for the `:local` pseudo.

```css
/* modular-css */
.localA :global(.global-b .global-c) .localD.localE :global(.global-d) { ... }
```

### Style overriding

In CSS Modules there is no support for modifying styles in rules that aren't direct ancestors via `composes`.

Discussion around potential solutions was happening in [css-modules/css-modules#147](https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules/issues/147) but eventually dried up.

`modular-css` has implemented the `:external()` proposal from that issue. More context is available in the [Overriding Styles section](#overriding-styles).

```css
/* input.css */
.input {
    width: 100%;
}

/* fieldset.css */
.fieldset :external(input from "./input.css") {
    width: 50%;
}
```

### Namespaces

CSS Modules allows for importing multiple values from an external file.

```css
/* CSS Modules */
@value one, two, three, red, blue, green, small, medium, large from "./constants.css";

.a {
  color: red;
  width: small;
}
```

`modular-css` implements a suggestion made in [css-modules/css-modules#186](https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules/issues/186#issuecomment-257421710) to allow importing all of a file's exported values and aliasing it for easy use. More documentation can be found in the [Namespaced values section](#namespaced-values).

```css
/* modular-css */
@value * as constants from "./constants.css";

.a {
  color: constants.red;
  width: constants.small;
}
```

### Support

CSS Modules is really only fully-supported as part of webpack these days. The repo is effectively mothballed, and there appears to be almost no one supporting the current codebase. Since webpack is the only live version & we prefer to use rollup for it's cleaner output and smaller bundles we needed an approach that could be flexibly be used with a [variety](#rollup) [of](#browserify) [tools](#cli).
