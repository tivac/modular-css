# Getting Started

There are a lot of different ways to use `modular-css`, pick your favorite!

## Rollup

```bash
> npm i @modular-css/rollup
```

Tiny bundles, code-splitting, and first-class `modular-css` support. 👌🏻

## Webpack

```bash
> npm i @modular-css/webpack
```

The popular choice. Not as full-featured or well-supported but should work out just fine.

## Browserify

```bash
> npm i @modular-css/browserify
```

The old standby, still works. Supports `factor-bundle` for painless CSS & JS bundle splitting!


## Svelte

```bash
> npm i @modular-css/svelte
```

Take your svelte components and power them up using `modular-css`! ⚡

## JS API

```bash
> npm i @modular-css/processor
```

The core of `modular-css`, reasonably usable and powers literally everything else.

## CLI

```bash
> npm i @modular-css/cli
```

`modular-css` via CLI, for those times where you need to try something really quickly.

## PostCSS Plugin

```bash
> npm i @modular-css/postcss
```

For those times when you've just gotta run some postcss inside of your postcss. 😵

## Globbing API

```bash
> npm i @modular-css/glob
```

Sometimes you just need to grab `**/*.css` and get a move on. The globbing API is here for you!
