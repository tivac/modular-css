# Getting Started

There are a lot of different ways to use `modular-css`, pick your favorite!

- [Rollup](#rollup) - Tiny bundles, code-splitting, and first-class `modular-css` support. 👌🏻
- [Webpack](#webpack) - Not as full-featured or well-supported as the rollup plugin but works pretty ok.
- [Browserify](#browserify) - The old standby. Supports `factor-bundle` for painless CSS bundle splitting!
- [Svelte](#svelte) - Take your svelte components and power them up using `modular-css`! ⚡
- [JS API](#js-api) - The core of `modular-css`, reasonably usable and powers literally everything else.
- [CLI](#cli) - `modular-css` via CLI, for those times where you need to try something really quickly.
- [PostCSS Plugin](#postcss-plugin) - Sometimes just gotta run some postcss inside of your postcss. 😵
- [Globbing API](#)- Grab `**/*.css` and get a move on. The globbing API is here for you!
